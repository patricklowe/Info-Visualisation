  <div class="desc">Q1. Attempt 1. Each line is an attribute of the coffee. The green line on the 
  top is the overall rating of the coffee. All attributes appear to follow the same direction as 
  eachother, except for when the graph hits its peak at an altitude of 2,000M. I felt this was a lot
  of overlapping information regarding a similair category and so decided to redesign the graph.</div>
</div>
<div class="gallery">
  <a>    <img src="Q1_Attempt_2.png" width="600" height="400">		</a>
  <div class="desc">With this attempt I used just the overall average rating VS the average altitude, with a heatmap of
  the count of records at that rating and altitude. There didn't appear to be any distinct changes so I scaled the graph
  down to 80-88 overall rating. This highlighted the differences more distinctly.</div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a>    <img src="Q2_Attempt_1.png" width="600" height="400">		</a>
  <div class="desc">This was the first failed attempt at this graph. It had the year of harvest on the X axis with the 
  country on the Y axis. There was little information shown on how much was sold, rather it showed if if a country made 
  any coffee sales that year.</div>
</div>
<div class="gallery">
  <a>    <img src="Q3_Attempt_1.png" width="600" height="400">		</a>
  <div class="desc">This graph was mid-design of Q3. It was plotting variety versus country. I was not loading the data in 
  correctly so it would not load the way I had intended. If I had stuck with this design, the information that would be presented
  would not be enough to answer the question. It was getting variety by the country, I had later decided to do variety VS defects.</div>
</div>

<div class="gallery">
  <a>    <img src="Q3_Attempt_3.png" width="600" height="400">		</a>
  <div class="desc">In this attempt I had tried to show the coffee variety, the country it came from, the count of defects, plus the overall
  rating of coffe from that region. Unfortunately the line for average rating was not as clear as I had hoped, and the count of defects was 
  too varying to receive a legible heatmap. Toying with other colours didn't really help this as the extreme became too intense, drawing attention
  away from the much paler data markers, or vice versa.</div>
</div>
<div class="gallery">
  <a>    <img src="Q3_Attempt_2.png" width="600" height="400">		</a>
  <div class="desc">This last image is more of a supplement for Question 3. It shows the variety/blend and from which farm it is most popular on.
  It should help the user understand if the defects are coming from the farm, or the variety as a variety with a high defect count coming from a 
  farm with a low defect farm could mean it is down to the variety (maybe insects prefer this blend, perhaps the conditions it is grown in affect it, etc).
  Whereas a variety with low defects coming from a Farm with high defect count could suggest that the farm is mishandling the beans in general.</div>
