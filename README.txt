There are 4 HTML files, one for each question and a file showing the images of each previous attempt.
All files are accessible through the navigation bar, top of each HTML. 

Recommend starting on Scores_VS_Altitude.html, as Question 1.

There is also a CSS file to keep easy formatting of all HTML files.
The cleansed/processed data is included in a CSV file, but is also accessible by the graphs on my GitHub account.
The CSV is only included as a backup.
