               <td style="vertical-align: top;"> This data set is based off of Arabica Coffee. It contains 
				information on which company owns the farm, the farm name, the country of production, the altitude 
				that the coffee was grown at, when it was harvested, how it was harvested, and finally the 
				attributes associated with the coffee (Aroma, body, balance, flavor etc).

            <tr>
               <td style=""><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></td>
               <td style="">This graph shows the overall rating of coffee per altitude range, 
			   and also the amount of farms that produce coffee at that altitude. Intuitively, the higher the bar the
			   better that the coffee has scored based on a combination of its attributes (Aroma, Acidity, Aftertaste,
			   Body, Balance, Flavor etc). The darker the bar the more coffee that was produced at that altitude range, 
			   on average.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td style=""><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
               <td style="">It appears that there are 2 peaks in this graph, the first is at 
			   400-500 Meters, and then it slowly picks up again until it reaches 2,000 Meters. The best coffee 
			   rating, on average, occurs at 2,000 to 2,100 meters before it dips. Interestingly, there only appears
			   to be 9 counts of coffee at this altitude, the most production of coffee occurs at 1,200M - 1,300M, 
			   and 1,700M - 1,800M at 107 counts. This could be due to the country of production being at that altitude. 
			   Coffee producers may not be willing to grow coffee at such altitudes as the cost of transport, maintenance,
			   and other such factors (maybe available land is limited at such heights) is probably not enough to justify 
			   ~4 rating points. I have included a screenshot of this chart where the scale is from 0-100, this better shows
			   the neglible difference in ratings by altitude. Overall, altitude appears to have a minor influence on coffee 
			   attributes, but it may help provide insight to startups about how to better advertise their products or how 
			   a coffee connoisseur should make a purchase. For example, Gardelli coffees are amongst the best rated coffee
			   in the world, by the Speciality Coffee Association.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td style=""><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
               <td style="">For this graph I had played around with heat maps (which didn't work with the data the way I had hoped),
			   line graphs (which I felt had too much data displayed), but settled on a bar chart that takes in aspects of a heat map 
			   (colour density of coffee count by altitude). I feel this graph allows users to view the average points per coffee, 
			   the altitude it was grown at, and the popularity (or commonality) of that coffee. It encapsulates a lot of data in an 
			   easily readable graph. I feel that viewers are immediately drawn to the darker blue bars (for popular coffees), 
			   then to the towering bar (for best coffee). I have included screenshots with this submission of previous attempts for this question.
			   Initially, I had tried to plot all the different attributes against the mean altitude, this should the same results but after hitting
			   a peak of 2,000M attributes dropped quicker than others, while this was interesting I felt the current bar chart/ heatmap combo 
			   provides a better insight as it also shows the popular altitude for growing coffee.

            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td style=""><strong>Data filtering and transformation:&nbsp;</strong></td>
               <td style="">I used the provided mean of altitude to base the heights off of, then filtered
			   these altitudes between 0 and 5,000 Meters. There was a very limited supply of data from 11,000M+ that I felt would
			   distract the viewer from the information, as it distorted the scale of the graph. I also filtered out altitudes that
			   were measured in feet (unit_of_measurement = ft), since the Altitude_mean_meters may or may not be accurate for these.
			   In terms of the csv, the link in our assignment gave 4 datasets to work from: Arabica Clean, Arabica Raw, Robusta Clean, and 
			   Robusta Raw. I chose to work from Arabica Clean, but did make some minor changes of my own. I cleaned up any double-quotes and 
			   some estranged characters throughout the company/producer names. I did notice that some names contained an accent that would look
			   odd in the csv file, but since it had no impact on data grouping, and does show up correctly in the graph I decided to leave it in.</td>
