               <td style="vertical-align: top;"> This data set is based off of Arabica Coffee. It contains 
				information on which company owns the farm, the farm name, the country of production, the altitude 
				that the coffee was grown at, when it was harvested, how it was harvested, and finally the 
				attributes associated with the coffee (Aroma, body, balance, flavor etc).

               <td style=""><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong></td>
               <td style="">This graph shows the total production of coffee (weight of each bag X total bags) by country for each year. The X
			   axis shows the year of production, the Y axis has each country, and the size of the points represents the total
			   coffee produced. The colour is only to help distinquish different countries.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td style=""><strong>Insight:</strong></td>
               <td style="">It would appear that Ethiopa, Guatemala, Colombia, and Brazil are the most frequent, largest producers of coffee from this 
				data set. While they have kept a steady supply of coffee, Mexico, Honduras, and El Savador have begun to climb the ranks. 
				There are countries with sporadic appearances of production on coffee, this could be due to a new blend being tested for the market, assuming
				that the data is reliable. This may be due to the increase in "speciality" coffee blends becoming a trend in recent years.</td>

               <td style=""><strong>Design considerations</strong></td>
               <td style="">For this graph I wanted to produce the amount of coffee by country, but then I had design issues with
			   what else to compare this with: farm, owner, if flavours improved by mass production, so I settled on production by 
			   the years. I then began designing the best way to represent this information. I work on line charts to see if certain
			   years were more valuable to certain countries, I found the vega-lite examples helped quickly aid in visualising the data
			   I was working with. The chart use allows for year, country, and amount to be encapsulated for legibility. While it is still 
			   difficult to represent the data clearly, I believe this graph presents data in a concise way to answer the question. I would have
			   liked to improve how coffee size was represented but there was too large of a leap between common coffee and large scale production.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td style=""><strong>Data filtering and transformation:&nbsp;</strong></td>
               <td style="">I created a new column ("Weight_Unit") which would mark if the coffee was weighed in Kilograms (KG) or pounds 
			   (LBS), and then filtered for Kilograms only. The weight unit was also removed from "Bag_Weight". Any columns were weight 
			   was not entered was ignored. I got the total weight produced each year by multiplying the bag weight by the total number of
			   bags. This was then filtered by year, of each country and the average weight that was produced that period. I also filtered some
			   outliers that severly threw of the scale of representation. I believe this was due to incorrectly filed data (110,000M in Nicaragua
			   when it has a max of 2,100M).</td>
