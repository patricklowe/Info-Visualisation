# Info-Visualisation
##### Arabica Coffee
The task was to create a visualisation through an online tool called Vega. Save the results and view through a custom HTML file. Data is based off of the Arabica Coffee Dataset
There are 4 HTML files, one for each question and a file showing the images of each previous attempt.
All files are accessible through the navigation bar, top of each HTML. 
Recommend starting on Scores_VS_Altitude.html, as Question 1.
There is also a CSS file to keep easy formatting of all HTML files.
